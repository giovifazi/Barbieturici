Please note: 
This was my second and third C code. It is bad code, dont take example from it.
It was written in the first semester of the first year of University.

I dont remember all the differences between the base VM and the full VM (Completa)
the base vm seems to traslate single files, the full translates all the .vm files
inside a dir.

BASE VM Instructions:

make
./VMtranslator

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FULL VM Instructions:

make
./VMtranslator /path/to/your/dir
